Since his full-length film debut in 2004 with The Place Promised in Our Early Days , Makoto Shinkai has been renowned for his beautiful art styles and attention to detail. However, while many detractors admit that he is second-to-none in terms of creating stunning visuals, they also argue that this is merely to cover for the lack of character development and a subpar plot. Makoto Shinkai‚Äôs fourth film, The Garden of Words , is no exception to these comments, with undeniably beautiful art combi.

No doubt about it 2016 was a great year for television. With new shows such as Westworld, Stranger Things, The Young Pope, Fleabag etc. premiering last year, 2016 proved that the bar for overall quality of Television is being raised and there are more worthwhile TV Series than ever before. The idea of the television platform being a step-down from movies is starting to fade. Between the cable networks and streaming platforms, TV is consistently becoming more valuable, due to more quality materia.
